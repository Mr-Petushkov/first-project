# Header-1 is the biggest among others.

~~Future python developer~~

## Header-2 is a little bit smaller than H1.

1. It is important to understand;
2. How numbered lists are made and what for.

### Header-3 is even smaller than H2, but still noticeable.

- non-numbered lists are also needed;
- especially for idiots like me;
- we talk about different Jaguars;
- smiling from Mclaren P1.

#### Header-4 roars like V8 from Chevrolet Camaro.

Examples of using _italics_ and **bold** fonts.
Moreover, I can highlight text like this `_` and `+`. XAXAXAXAAA

##### Header-5 is small, if you didn't see H6.

Sometimes I highlight text as code:
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
   printf("Hello, world!\n");
   return 0;
}
```
